# Ascent Universe

A companion website for the Ascent Universe — a science fiction setting spanning from deep Dyn prehistory (~100,000 BCE) to the far-future Apathy War (~3200 CE).

## Authorship

The Ascent Universe is a human-authored science fiction project. The original novels and short stories were written by the author over several years. Some newer short stories and editorial work on this site were done collaboratively with Claude (Anthropic).

The website itself (HTML/CSS/JS, interactive readers, MSD, battle simulation, codex, etc.) was built collaboratively with Claude.

## Live Site

Hosted via GitHub Pages. All pages are static HTML/CSS/JS with no build step. Two display modes:
- **Dark mode** — terminal/military-intelligence aesthetic (monospace, cyan/orange)
- **Light mode** — clean, simple reading mode (system fonts, minimal decoration)

Toggle using the theme button in the nav bar.

## Shared Resources

- `style.css` — Shared theme with dark and light modes
- `nav.js` — Injected navigation bar, theme toggle, status bar, and in-universe clock

## Reference Documents

- **`UNIVERSE_REFERENCE.md`** — Comprehensive reference: synopses, characters, factions, technology, themes, continuity
- **`BRAINSTORMING.md`** — Development log and notes
- **`AI_ADVICE.md`** — Practical advice for AI models working on this project

## AI Collaboration

This project was built collaboratively with Claude Code (Anthropic). The following files guide AI sessions:

- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Project conventions, creative writing guidelines, and git procedures
- **`AI_ADVICE.md`** — Detailed advice for AI models working on this universe
- **`insights-report.html`** — Usage analytics and workflow insights from Claude Code sessions

### Key procedures for AI collaborators

1. **Read `AI_ADVICE.md` and `UNIVERSE_REFERENCE.md` before creative work** — canon consistency matters
2. **Commit after every chapter, page, or section** — never batch to the end
3. **Creative rewrites: expand, never cut** — preserve texture, atmosphere, and subtext
4. **Re-read files before editing** — special characters (smart quotes, em dashes) cause mismatches
5. **Report word counts** before and after any rewrite

## Development

No build step needed — edit HTML files directly and push. The `msd/` directory contains a separate React/Vite project for the MSD component.
